# Nuxeo Support Tools

This repository exposes a searchable version of all tickets fixed for a given maintenance branch.

For each LTS version, all the fixed tickets are listed and aggregated by hotfix.
The main interests are:
* have a page with all the fixes for a given version
* quickly find if a installation notes are available for a hotfix
* be able to search in your browser with the simple Ctrl+F feature among all the tickets summary

The listing will be improved to indicate the hotfixes which contain a security fix.
